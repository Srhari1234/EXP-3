# EXP-3
AIM: To study and implement operators and bitwise operators in C++

THEORY: These are basically symbols that operate on operands. There are five types of operators in c++ which is also used in the codes

1.arithmetic operator (+,-,,/,%,++,--). these are the basic mathematical operators 2.assigment operator(=,+=,-=,=,/=). these are used to assign value 3.comparision operator (==,<=,>=,!=). these are relational operators 4.logical operator (&&,||,!). these are to combine conditional statements 5.bitwise opertor (&,|,^,-,<<,>>). bit level operations
